# Cosmic-Canvas
"Cosmic Canvas" is an interactive 2D gravity simulator where you can create, destroy, and manipulate your own planetary systems. Watch as planets merge and evolve into massive stars and black holes, or load pre-built scenarios like a realistic Solar System, a chaotic binary star system, and more.
